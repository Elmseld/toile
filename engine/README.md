# @toile/engine

The pattern engine: pure TypeScript that turns measurements and a pattern definition into geometry.
It has no UI and no I/O, so the editor, the PDF export and the server all use the same code.

```bash
bun install

## Formulas

`evaluateFormulas({ measurements, parameters, formulas })` (in `src/formula/`) evaluates named
formulas such as `waist / 4 + ease_waist` with a custom parser (no `eval`). See
`docs/adr/0003-formula-language.md` for the reasoning.

- **Syntax.** Numbers (`12`, `12.5`), `+ - * /` with usual precedence and left associativity,
  parentheses, unary minus, references by identifier, and function calls. No `.5`, exponents or
  decimal comma.
- **Functions.** `sqrt`, `abs`, `rad`, `deg`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos` take one argument;
  `min` and `max` take one or more; `atan2(y, x)` takes two. Angles are in degrees (`sin/cos/tan`
  take degrees, `asin/acos/atan2` return degrees); `rad()` and `deg()` convert. Lengths are mm.
- **Namespace.** Measurements, parameters and formulas share one namespace. A name in two sources is
  a `duplicate_name` error. Formulas may reference each other in any declaration order.
- **Result.** `{ ok: true, values }` or `{ ok: false, values, errors }`. `values` holds every valid
  measurement and parameter plus every formula that evaluated, even when others failed.
- **Errors** are values, never thrown. Each has `kind`, `name` and (mostly) a `span` of 0-based
  offsets into the formula source: `syntax`, `unknown_function`, `wrong_argument_count`,
  `invalid_argument`, `unknown_reference`, `division_by_zero`, `invalid_result`,
  `circular_dependency`, `failed_dependency`, `invalid_name`, `duplicate_name`, `invalid_value`.
  `message` is English developer text; build UI text from `kind` and the fields.
- **Cycles.** Each group of mutually dependent formulas gets one `circular_dependency`, whose
  `cycle` is the group's shortest cycle through its first-declared member (e.g.
  `["a", "b", "c", "a"]`). Every other member of the group gets `failed_dependency` (on the next
  member of the cycle when it is on it), as does every formula that depends on a failed name. A
  formula that already has an error (such as an unknown reference) keeps only that one; the cycle
  is then headed by the first-declared member that has not failed.
- **Limits.** Formulas over 10 000 characters or nested deeper than 100 levels are `syntax` errors.
- **Lower level.** `parseFormula(source, options?)`, `references` and
  `evaluateExpression(expr, lookup, options?)` are exported for callers (such as geometry) that
  resolve names themselves. `options.functions` replaces the function table (default `FUNCTIONS`);
  a `FunctionSpec` with `takes: "names"` receives its arguments as bare names, unevaluated (for
  example `distance(A, B)`). Use the same table for parsing and evaluation. A function that returns
  a non-finite number or throws gives an `invalid_result` error for its call; a `lookup` that
  throws (or returns a non-finite number) gives one on the span of the reference.
